# Chat Summary

In this chat, you asked about the relationship between the mean, median, and skewness in distributions, as well as factors that cause skewness. I explained how right skew (positive skew) and left skew (negative skew) affect the relationship between the mean and median. Right-skewed distributions have a mean greater than the median, while left-skewed distributions have a mean less than the median.

Next, you shared a Python code snippet that generates random samples from a Gamma distribution using `scipy.stats` to create right- and left-skewed distributions. I explained the key differences between these distributions, highlighting how negating the values of a right-skewed distribution results in a left-skewed distribution. I also pointed out how the mean and median behave in both cases.

You now have a better understanding of how skewness affects the distribution of data and its impact on statistical measures like the mean and median.
