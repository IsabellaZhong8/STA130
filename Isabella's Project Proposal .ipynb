    "This analysis will explore the relationship between time spent on social media and perceived social balance, aiming to identify individuals who rely most heavily on online interactions. By examining these patterns, we can see how a strong bias for social media affects loneliness and overall wellness. Moreover, we’ll analyze the correlations between high social media usage and reported levels of loneliness and mental health, which provides insights to how online interactions may influence personal well-being and in-person social abilities.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. <b>Violin plot/KDE<b>\n",
    "\n",
    "A violin plot can illustrate how social media integrates into daily life by visualizing the distribution of time spent online. Three violin plots can be created, each representing a different category of perceived time balance on social media: 'too much time,' 'too little time,' and 'just the right amount of time.' For each plot, the left side shows the distribution of responses based on the LIFESTYLE_time_use_balance_media variable, while the right side shows the CONNECTION_social_media_time_per_day variable. This approach provides a clearer view of what level of online interaction is considered balanced, highlighting patterns and potential biases in social media use.\n",

    "2. <b>Box plot<b>\n",

    "A box plot can be used to inform the relationship between the different categories of  LIFESTYLE_time_use_balance_media and the scores of LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_companionship or WELLNESS_self_rated_mental_health. The scores will be on the y-axis, while each box plot is a different answer to the time used to balance social media. Thus, we can analyze the quartiles, and any outliers that occur in the data. This provides us with a better idea as to how much online interactions may affect us mentally, and gives us insight as to whether there is a correlation between the two. \n",

    "Bootstrapping a simulation of samples, where we can calculate the r value between CONNECTION_social_media_time_per_day, and the two wellness variables: LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_companionship and WELLNESS_self_rated_mental_health. Since there are three variables, two histograms will be made: one for online time vs. loneliness and one for online time vs. mental health. Analyzing these histogram will help show the nature of their relationships, ie. analyzing modality, confidence intervals, variance, standard deviation, etc. \n",

By comparing these median financial rankings, we can infer potential relationships - if higher financial rankings are associated with responses indicating greater effectiveness in connecting with others, this would support a positive correlation between social ease in the workplace and financial success\n",

    "We can model the correlation between using linear regression where the dependent variable would be the financial ranking, and the independent variable can be social comfort or effectiveness of creating connections in the workplace (in which case we would perform linear regression twice, one for each independent variable). Thus, we can use the linear regression model: Y = B0 + B1*xi, and evaluate what the slope (B1) of the line is using the least squares method (which helps minimize the sum of squared residuals - aka epsilon). \n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, we can run a hypothesis test, where the null (H0) is that there is no linear correlation (b1 = 0) - this shows whether the slope that we just found is statistically significant or the result of random static noise. Setting the significance level as 0.05 (under the assumption that the null is true), if the p-value is significantly below the significance level, it indicates there is a strong correlation between the two variables. To further demonstrate the strength of the correlation, we can find the R2 value, where the closer it is to 1, the stronger the correlation. \n",

Furthermore, we can identify whether it is a positive or negative correlation based on the slope value. Since the hypothesis test has shown how B1 is statistically significant, then if B1 > 0, then there is a positive correlation, whereas if B1 < 0, then there is negative correlation. I hypothesize that B1 will be positive, thus allowing us to make the inference that there indeed is a linear correlation between connecting with others/social comfort and a prosperous life\n",

Our test statistic that we will focus on is the correlation coefficient between loneliness post-covid and social anxiety. Thus, we can calculate the observed test statistic using a hypothetical mean of 5, and permutate the data (following the same procedure of calculating the test statistic), which will create a null distribution. Then, we can find the p-value (which is the % of permutation test statistics that are as or more extreme than the observed test statistic). Under the assumption that the null is true, if the p-value is less than the significance value (0.05), then we can reject the null hypothesis. \n",
